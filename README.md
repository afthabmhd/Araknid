## Compiler Integration

Araknid comes bundled with built-in support for **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)**:

- Automatically compiles the generated C code in the background
- Provides detailed compile-time error output inside the interface
- Allows for one-click run and output viewing
- Works on systems with GCC installed (pre-installed on most Linux distros)
- Compatible with external C compilers if configured manually

> Make sure `gcc` is installed on your system. You can install it via:
> ```bash
> sudo apt install build-essential
> ```
